tep 3: Customize your homepage

Nice work setting the theme! :sparkles:

You can customize your homepage by adding content to either an index.md file or the README.md file. GitHub Pages first looks for an
index.md file. Your repository has an index.md file so we can update it to include your personalized content.

:keyboard: Activity: Create your homepage

1 Browse to the index.md file in the my-pages branch.
2 In the upper right corner, open the file editor.
3 Type the content you want on your homepage. You can use Markdown formatting on this page.
4 (optional) You can also modify title: or just ignore it for now. We’ll discuss it in the next step.
5 Commit your changes to the my-pages branch.
6 Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you’re following instructions from). GitHub Actions will automatically update
 to the next step.
